The emerging capability of cancer progression through resistance mechanisms and alternative signaling pathways requires
an exemplifying shift towards multi-target therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Targeting the pair of EGFR(Epidermal
Growth Factor Receptor) and MET(Mesenchymal–epithelial transition) proteins demonstrates a clinically-approved strategy
to overcome the existing drug resistance for treating non-small cell lung cancer. Amivantamab, a bispecific antibody which
has been proven clinically efficient against drug resistance but also possess some critical setbacks including infusion-related
reactions (IRRs), hepatotoxicity and limited blood-brain barrier penetration. Therefore, we introduce an integrated transformerbased diversity-driven reinforcement learning framework, ideally designed for dual-target aware de-novo molecular generation
against EGFR and MET. This approach encompasses three crucial challenges in multi-target de-novo molecular generation
including maintenance of drug-like properties through AlphaFold2-derived protein embedded molecular generation, invalid
SMILES(Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) generation with the use of validated SELFIES(Self-Referencing
Embedded Strings) and mode collapse through exploration of diverse chemical scaffolds. Computational validation included
molecular docking, pharmacology profiling and retrospective analysis which demonstrated that a diverse library of novel dual
inhibitors has been generated with superior drug-like properties. Besides, our study included the exploration of chemical space
of existing dual inhibitors from ChEMBL to address oncological pathways through polypharmacology
